A module is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the Node.js require() function.

To be loaded by the Node.js require() function, a module must be one of the following:

    A folder with a package.json file containing a "main" field.
    A JavaScript file.

**Note:** Since modules are not required to have a `package.json` file, not all modules are packages. Only modules that have a `package.json` file are also packages.

In the context of a Node program, the module is also the thing that was loaded from a file. For example, in the following program:

var req = require('request')

we might say that "The variable req refers to the request module".
